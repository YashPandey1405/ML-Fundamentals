## 📌 Concepts Covered

- Understanding time series components: **trend, seasonality, noise**
- Parsing & cleaning datetime data with `pandas`
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` & `seaborn`
- Feature engineering for time series
- Forecasting models:

  - 📉 **ARIMA / SARIMA**
  - 🔁 **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
  - 🧠 Optional: Prophet, XGBoost for time series
