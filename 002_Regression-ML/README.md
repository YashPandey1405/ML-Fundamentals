# üìå Regression & Its Types

## üîç What is Regression?

Regression is a **statistical and machine learning technique** used to model the relationship between a **dependent variable (y)** and one or more **independent variables (X)**. It helps in **predicting continuous values** based on input features.

## üìä Types of Regression

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Linear Regression**

- Finds a straight-line relationship between X and y.
- Equation: **y = mX + b**
- Example: Predicting house prices based on size.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Multiple Linear Regression**

- Extension of linear regression with **multiple independent variables**.
- Example: Predicting salary based on experience, education, and age.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Polynomial Regression**

- Models non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms.
- Example: Growth rate of a population over time.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Logistic Regression** (For Classification)

- Predicts **categorical outcomes** (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1).
- Example: Spam detection (Spam or Not Spam).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Ridge & Lasso Regression** (Regularized Regression)

- Helps **prevent overfitting** in models with many features.
- Ridge adds **L2 regularization**, Lasso adds **L1 regularization**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

- Uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** concepts for regression.
- Works well with **small datasets** and outliers.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Decision Tree & Random Forest Regression**

- Uses tree-based methods for non-linear relationships.
- Example: Predicting stock prices.
