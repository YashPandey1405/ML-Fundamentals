# 🧠 Logistic Regression in Python

This project demonstrates a general pipeline to implement **Logistic Regression** using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## ✅ Steps to Implement

### 1. 📦 Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
```

---

### 2. 📊 Load and Prepare the Data

```python
# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Split features and target
X = df.iloc[:, :-1]  # Features
y = df.iloc[:, -1]   # Target
```

---

### 3. ✂️ Split into Train and Test Sets

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

---

### 4. 🧠 Train the Model

```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### 5. 📈 Evaluate the Model

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

## 🚀 Done!

This is a simple template for any logistic regression classification task. Customize it with your dataset and explore more metrics!
