# SVM & Naive Bayes Code Implementations

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks implementing **SVM** (Support Vector Machine) and **Naive Bayes** classifiers and regressors. The notebooks demonstrate the application of these algorithms in machine learning tasks.

### Notebooks in this Folder:

1. **SVM Classifier**:

   - Implements SVM for classification tasks.
   - Covers training, prediction, and evaluation of SVM models for classification problems.

2. **SVM Regressor**:

   - Implements SVM for regression tasks.
   - Demonstrates how to apply SVM to predict continuous values.

3. **SVM Kernel**:

   - Explores different SVM kernel functions: **Polynomial**, **RBF**, and **Sigmoid**.
   - Shows how to choose and implement different kernels based on the data.

4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**:
   - Implements the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier.
   - Demonstrates training and evaluation on a dataset, along with interpretation of the model.

### Key Features:

- **SVM** is demonstrated for both classification and regression, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm.
- **Naive Bayes** is applied using the Gaussian variant, useful for continuous data with Gaussian distribution.
