## 📁 PCA (Principal Component Analysis) with Python

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is an **unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique** that is used to transform data into a new set of variables, called **principal components** (PCs). These components are linear combinations of the original features, and they are ordered by the amount of variance they explain in the data. The goal of PCA is to reduce the number of features in the dataset while preserving as much information (variance) as possible.

### 🧑‍🏫 PCA Overview

PCA is primarily used for:

- **Reducing dimensionality** of large datasets while maintaining the variance.
- **Improving performance** and computational efficiency by eliminating redundant features.
- **Visualizing high-dimensional data** in 2D or 3D by projecting data onto the first few principal components.

### 🔑 Key Steps in PCA

1. **Standardization**:

   - PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data, so it’s important to standardize the dataset (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) before applying PCA.

2. **Covariance Matrix**:

   - A covariance matrix is computed to understand how the features of the data relate to each other.

3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:

   - Eigenvalues represent the variance captured by each principal component, and eigenvectors define the direction of each component in the feature space.

4. **Choosing the Number of Components**:

   - The **explained variance ratio** helps determine how many principal components are needed. Typically, we select components that explain 95% or more of the variance.

5. **Transforming the Data**:

   - The data is projected onto the selected principal components to reduce its dimensionality.

### 📊 PCA Implementation in this Repository

- **Data Standardization**: The dataset is first standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
- **PCA Transformation**: The `PCA` object from scikit-learn is used to fit and transform the data.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations of the explained variance ratio for each principal component and the transformed data in reduced dimensions (e.g., 2D or 3D).

### 🖼️ Visualization Example

- **Explained Variance Plot**: A plot showing the variance explained by each principal component to help determine the optimal number of components.
- **2D or 3D Scatter Plot**: Visualizing the data in reduced dimensions using the first few principal components.
