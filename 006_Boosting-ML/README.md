# üöÄ Boosting Algorithms in Machine Learning

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter Notebook implementations of various **Boosting techniques** in Machine Learning, along with **Hyperparameter Tuning** to maximize model performance.

## üåü What is Boosting in Machine Learning?

**Boosting** is a powerful ensemble technique designed to **convert weak learners into strong learners**.  
Rather than building a single complex model, Boosting creates a **series of models** where each model attempts to correct the errors made by its predecessor.  
The final prediction is a **weighted combination** of all models.

Key highlights of Boosting:

- üìà Focuses on **errors**: It gives more weight to incorrectly predicted instances in each round.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Sequential training**: Models are trained one after the other, not in parallel.
- üß† **Reduces bias and variance**, leading to better generalization.
- üèÜ Often achieves **state-of-the-art results** in structured/tabular data competitions (e.g., Kaggle).

Popular Boosting algorithms include:

- **AdaBoost** (Adaptive Boosting)
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
