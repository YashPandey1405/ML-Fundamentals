# 🚨 Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection refers to the process of identifying rare items, events, or observations which differ significantly from the majority of the data. These anomalies can point to critical incidents such as fraud, structural defects, medical problems, or system failures. Since anomalies are rare, they are often hard to detect and require specialized machine learning techniques. This folder showcases some of the most effective unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms through practical implementations in Python.

## 📁 Contents

1. **Isolation Forest**

   - Detects anomalies by isolating observations in a tree structure.
   - Efficient for high-dimensional datasets.

2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**

   - Identifies clusters and labels points that don’t belong to any cluster as anomalies.
   - Great for datasets with noise and irregular cluster shapes.

3. **LOF (Local Outlier Factor)**
   - Measures local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors.
   - Ideal for identifying density-based anomalies.
